# Led Strip Contest: Example Code
Here you can find example code for the Bastli Led Strip Contest 2015/2016 (http://bastli.ch/contest). You might use it for reference or as a starting point for your code.

If you have working code in some funny programming language like Haskell, please make a merge request.

## TouchDesigner ##
This Windows VJ software has very broad capabilities for interactive performances. It is based on a realtime data-graph approach, meaning you can interconnect Audio, Textures, Images, UI, and 3D in one consisting and fast way. On top of that you can script everything with Python. You get a non-commercial version of TouchDesigner at https://www.derivative.ca/.

Just start the `touchdesigner/main.toe` file and it should work.
